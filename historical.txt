Place:  Oculus OC0.03
Description: Do you want to be part of the executive team for one of the biggest societies at Warwick, and one of the best nationally? Now's your chance! Engineering Society Elections will be held on Thursday the 27th February 2020. 

***For full information on elections and guidelines, please visit engsoc.uk/elections***

Everyone who is running for an executive position must send a one slide powerpoint, to president@warwickengineers.co.uk outlining their manifesto, and will be asked to make a speech on election day. YOUR vote decides who will be on the executive team for next year! Deadline for nominations is: Tuesday 25th February 2020 23:59

All members are welcome to come and vote. **THERE WILL BE LOTS OF PIZZA AND REFRESHMENTS ON THE DAY!!**

**Please note that you will need to have been a member of the society for this year for at least two weeks prior to the elections to vote for a candidate** 

"I would thoroughly encourage anyone thinking about running for the society to go for it because you never know what could happen - it's a decision that can really have a positive effect in ways that you may not at first realise. Being part of a large society, such as EngSoc is indicative of the responsibilities you might have when working at a larger firm and you get to develop exactly the sort of skills firms are looking for. You also get to meet a bunch of great people and learn a lot more about yourself. If you're hesitant in applying or have any queries, feel free to drop me an email at i.verma@warwick.ac.uk or send Ishaan Verma a message on facebook. I’ll be more than happy to help out in any way I can!” Ishaan Verma (President 2019/20)

Michael Andronicou and Nadir Rutherfoord were in exactly the same position as you last year. Both graduated from Warwick with degrees in Engineering in July 2017 and started on the Shell graduate scheme just two months ago. Both interned at Shell in the summer of 2016.

Who are the presenters?

Michael graduated with an MEng Manufacturing and Mechanical Engineering. He is on the three year Downstream Commercial Graduate Programme, based in London. His first of two 18 month placements is in Shell's trading arm. He is responsible for executing traders' deals, commanding a fleet of vessels to move gas across the world.

Nadir graduated with an MEng in Civil Engineering. He is on the Upstream Graduate Programme, based in Aberdeen. Unlike Michael's Programme, Nadir's is technical in nature. His first rotation is part of the Brent Decommissioning Team, whose job it is to safely uninstall four offshore installations, in the largest project of its kind. Nadir has already been offshore in his first two months of his graduate programme!

One of the worst medical conditions imaginable is locked-in syndrome. It leaves you totally paralyzed except perhaps for the blink of an eye. Your intelligent mind is locked inside a useless body, able to sense everything but unable to communicate. It could happen to anyone, out of the blue, as a result of a stroke. If you wanted to help people with locked-in syndrome, the obvious thing might be to become a doctor or nurse, but how could a computer scientist help?

‘The Diving Bell and the Butterfly’ is an incredibly uplifting book. It’s the autobiography of Jean-Dominique Bauby, written after he woke up in a hospital bed totally paralysed. In the book, he describes life with locked-in syndrome. He did have a way to communicate not only to write the book but also with medics, friends and family. He did it without any technology at all.  How?

PLEASE RSVP ONLY IF YOU ARE COMING! As I am using these numbers to hire out the tea room! If you are a fresher and will be following me (Joanna Vijaykumar) or Sama, please message us on facebook to let us know so we wait for you!

If you don't have Pop tickets, thats FINE!, come along to Beer Pong and Circle anyway!!

Bring your friends along !! We will be providing the equipment and drink required for Beer Pong, but of course, BYOB for the circle, which will be 100 times cheaper than hosting the circle in the bars around campus.
